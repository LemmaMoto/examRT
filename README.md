Python Robotics Simulator
================================

This is a simple, portable robot simulator developed by [Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org).
Some of the arenas and the exercises have been modified for the Research Track I course

Installing and running
----------------------

The simulator requires a Python 2.7 or Python 3 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/) library, [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).

Pygame, unfortunately, can be tricky (though [not impossible](http://askubuntu.com/q/312767)) to install in virtual environments. If you are using `pip`, you might try `pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame`, or you could use your operating system's package manager. Windows users could use [Portable Python](http://portablepython.com/). PyPyBox2D and PyYAML are more forgiving, and should install just fine using `pip` or `easy_install`.

## Troubleshooting

When running `python run.py <file>`, you may be presented with an error: `ImportError: No module named 'robot'`. This may be due to a conflict between sr.tools and sr.robot. To resolve, symlink simulator/sr/robot to the location of sr.tools.

On Ubuntu, this can be accomplished by:
* Find the location of srtools: `pip show sr.tools`
* Get the location. In my case this was `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`
* Create symlink: `ln -s path/to/simulator/sr/robot /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sr/`

## Exercise
-----------------------------

To run one or more scripts in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file names. 

```bash
$ python3 run.py <file_name>
```

# Token Handling Robot

This Python program is designed to simulate a robot that can locate, pick up, and pair tokens in a simple arena. The robot is equipped with a set of functions to control its movement, grab and release tokens, and identify the tokens and their pairings. The program is created for a Python Robotics Simulator and uses the Student Robotics API.

## Program Overview

The program is intended to operate within a simulated environment using a Python Robotics Simulator. It simulates a robot capable of the following tasks:

1. **Token Detection:** The robot scans its environment for tokens. It identifies unpaired tokens and searches for their paired counterparts.

2. **Token Pairing:** The robot pairs unpaired tokens with their corresponding tokens.

3. **Movement Control:** It can move forward, turn, and stop as needed to reach and manipulate tokens.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites:**

    - **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    - **Python Robotics Simulator:** You should have the Python Robotics Simulator installed.

2. **Running the Program:**

    Execute the program using the Python Robotics Simulator with the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 run.py <your-script>.py
    ```

    Replace `<your-script>` with the name `assignment` to run the simulation.

## Program Structure

- `run.py`: Entry point to run the program using the Python Robotics Simulator.

- `assignment.py`: Contains the main robot control functions for movement, token detection, pairing, and more.

- `assignment_more_readable.py`: Contains a more readable solution that works exactly the same as `assignment.py` but i didn't had time to rewrite the pseudo-code and i'm not sure that is a best practice .

## Customization

You can customize the program by adjusting the threshold values for distance and angle (`a_th`, `d_th`, `d_th_2_pair`) and by modifying the robot's behavior based on your specific requirements.

## Possible Improvements

- Implement additional error handling and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected situations effectively.
- Integrate more advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms to improve the robot's efficiency.
- Enhance the visual feedback to provide a more detailed view of the robot's surroundings.
- Consider additional functionalities such as token ordering, more complex token manipulation, or real-time monitoring.

Robot API
---------

The API for controlling a simulated robot is designed to be as similar as possible to the [SR API][sr-api].

### Motors ###

The simulated robot has two motors configured for skid steering, connected to a two-output [Motor Board](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/motor_board). The left motor is connected to output `0` and the right motor to output `1`.

The Motor Board API is identical to [that of the SR API](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/motors/), except that motor boards cannot be addressed by serial number. So, to turn on the spot at one quarter of full power, one might write the following:

```python
R.motors[0].m0.power = 25
R.motors[0].m1.power = -25
```

### The Grabber ###

The robot is equipped with a grabber, capable of picking up a token which is in front of the robot and within 0.4 metres of the robot's centre. To pick up a token, call the `R.grab` method:

```python
success = R.grab()
```

The `R.grab` function returns `True` if a token was successfully picked up, or `False` otherwise. If the robot is already holding a token, it will throw an `AlreadyHoldingSomethingException`.

To drop the token, call the `R.release` method.

Cable-tie flails are not implemented.

### Vision ###

To help the robot find tokens and navigate, each token has markers stuck to it, as does each wall. The `R.see` method returns a list of all the markers the robot can see, as `Marker` objects. The robot can only see markers which it is facing towards.

Each `Marker` object has the following attributes:

* `info`: a `MarkerInfo` object describing the marker itself. Has the following attributes:
  * `code`: the numeric code of the marker.
  * `marker_type`: the type of object the marker is attached to (either `MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD`, `MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER` or `MARKER_ARENA`).
  * `offset`: offset of the numeric code of the marker from the lowest numbered marker of its type. For example, token number 3 has the code 43, but offset 3.
  * `size`: the size that the marker would be in the real game, for compatibility with the SR API.
* `centre`: the location of the marker in polar coordinates, as a `PolarCoord` object. Has the following attributes:
  * `length`: the distance from the centre of the robot to the object (in metres).
  * `rot_y`: rotation about the Y axis in degrees.
* `dist`: an alias for `centre.length`
* `res`: the value of the `res` parameter of `R.see`, for compatibility with the SR API.
* `rot_y`: an alias for `centre.rot_y`
* `timestamp`: the time at which the marker was seen (when `R.see` was called).

For example, the following code lists all of the markers the robot can see:

```python
markers = R.see()
print "I can see", len(markers), "markers:"

for m in markers:
    if m.info.marker_type in (MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD, MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER):
        print " - Token {0} is {1} metres away".format( m.info.offset, m.dist )
    elif m.info.marker_type == MARKER_ARENA:
        print " - Arena marker {0} is {1} metres away".format( m.info.offset, m.dist )
```
